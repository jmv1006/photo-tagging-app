# Where's Waldo: On Tatooine!
This is my first major project in which I combine my frontend with a backend! In this case, I utilized Cloud Firestore from Firebase.

In this app, you are a new recruit to The Resistance, where you are called upon to help find some old friends on the desert planet of Tatooine! 

## Technologies Utilized

### React
### React Router
### Google Firestore
### Google Firebase Hosting

## Key Concepts Learned
There are some of the most important things I learned in this project:

### Working With A Backend
Hands down, the most significant thing I learned when it came to this project was structuring my backend. At first, I jumped right into the deep-end and tried to take the "figure it out as I code" route, but I SOON realized that I was just making things more difficult for myself. I learned the importance of taking the time to actually PLAN OUT how my backend would be structured. By doing so, I was able to structure it in a way where my frontend could communicate with it seamlessly. 

### Working With Multiple Technologies Is Not Easy
It took a lot of trial and error in order for me to get all of my technologies to work together. Whether it was setting up Firebase Hosting or learning how to fetch data from the Firestore database and import it into my JS code, getting all the technologies used to work together seamlessly took time. The experience definitely reinforced an idea that I have held onto sinced I began programming, that patience is the KEY to everything!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
